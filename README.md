# Twitter Quotes Bot
![Top Page Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## About the Project
This project is for building my own Twitter bot that publishes different famous quotes with a random emoji on Twitter feed every hour. It's built with a [Twitter gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter). This application can be run on your local PC, and also you can deploy it with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.

6. Go to your Twitter feed and check if the tweet is correctly tweeted


### How to deploy your bot with Heroku

### How to change the time interval

1. Go to the line `sleep` inside a loop in bin/main.rb
2. Now, it's set 3600 that means it's done every 1 hour, you can change the number whatever you like to set the interval
3. It's based on the second, so if you want to post your tweet every 1 min, you can change the number to 60 eg: `sleep 60`
