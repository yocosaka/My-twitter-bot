# Twitter Quotes Bot
![Top Page Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## About the Project
This project is for building my own Twitter bot that publishes different famous quotes with a random emoji on Twitter feed every hour. It's built with a [chatterbot platform](https://github.com/muffinista/chatterbot) which uses the Twitter gem to handle the underlying API calls. So we can also use the [Twitter gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) directly without installing the original gem on your project.

This application can be run on your local PC, and also you can deploy it with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
